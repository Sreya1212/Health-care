# Health Care Project
NIDDK (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) research creates knowledge about and treatments for the most chronic, costly, and consequential diseases.

The dataset used in this project is originally from NIDDK. The objective is to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.
Build a model to accurately predict whether the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not.

## Dataset Description
The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable (Outcome). Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and more.

## Approach:
### Data Exploration:
- Performed descriptive analysis. Analyzed the variables and their corresponding values. 

- Treated missing values (ie value of zero indicate missing value) and visually explored the variables using histogram.

- Created a count (frequency) plot describing the data types and the count of variables and count of outcomes by their value.

- Created scatter charts between the pair of variables to understand the relationships between variables.

- Performed correlation analysis by visually exploring it using a heat map.
### Data Modeling:
- Devised strategies for model building and applied an appropriate classification algorithm to build a model.

- Compared various models with the results from KNN algorithm and created a classification report by analyzing sensitivity, specificity, AUC (ROC curve), etc.

### Data Reporting:
Created a dashboard in tableau by choosing appropriate chart types and metrics useful for the business. The dashboard must entail the following:

1. Pie chart to describe the diabetic or non-diabetic population

2. Scatter charts between relevant variables to analyze the relationships

3. Histogram or frequency charts to analyze the distribution of the data

4. Heatmap of correlation analysis among the relevant variables

5. Created bins of these age values: 20-25, 25-30, 30-35, etc. Analyzed different variables for these age brackets using a bubble chart.
